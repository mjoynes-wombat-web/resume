I am a web developer, graphic designer, and avid problem solver. I have worked in a range of jobs and believe I can better myself in any situation.\
I love clear and concise designs. Finding information should be simple. Visuals should enhance messages and guide users to the content they seek.\
People are complex and surprising. Putting them in boxes does everyone a disservice. Viewing individuals complexly helps me come up with unique and effective solutions for each challenge.\
